{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. Credit card applications\n<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>\n<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>\n<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>\n<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>\n<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.</p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"id":"da40c4a8-690f-4f49-b4e9-dfa93330efce","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import pandas\n# ...

The probable features in a typical credit card application are <code>Gender</code>, <code>Age</code>, <code>Debt</code>, <code>Married</code>, <code>BankCustomer</code>, <code>EducationLevel</code>, <code>Ethnicity</code>, <code>YearsEmployed</code>, <code>PriorDefault</code>, <code>Employed</code>, <code>CreditScore</code>, <code>DriversLicense</code>, <code>Citizen</code>, <code>ZipCode</code>, <code>Income</code> and finally the <code>ApprovalStatus</code>. This gives us a pretty good starting point, and we can map these features with respect to the columns in the output.   </p>\n<p>As we can see from our first glance at the data, the dataset has a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features.

A question to ask is: <em>are the features that affect the credit card approval decision process correlated with each other?</em> Although we can measure correlation, that is outside the scope of this notebook, so we'll rely on our intuition that they indeed are correlated for now. Because of this correlation, we'll take advantage of the fact that generalized linear models perform well in these cases.
